				<div class="header">ABOUT ME</div>
				<p>I just obtained this domain (special thanks to MHacks) so this website is currently on its way to being done. In the meantime feel free to see what I'm up to below!</p>
				<p>Hi there! I'm Peter Flanagan, and I am computer science major at the University of Michigan. I was born in rainy Seattle Washington, and moved around until the third grade when I found my home in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I began programming in middle school when my computer applications teacher told me I made a decent looking website. That year I submitted a small website on Fractal Geometry to the <a href="https://seelio.com/w/10v9/pennsylvania-state-computer-fair?student=flanapet">PA State Computer Fair</a>. I won second place at the state finals, and was instantly trust into a world of wanting to know more.</p>
				<p>Since then I've improved my web designing skills, done graphic desing for my student organization, and have expanded my programming knowledge into other areas.</p>

					<p>Click here to view the MRun website project I am working on! </p>

				<a href="/PaceCalculator">
					<h1>Pace Calculator</h1>
					<p>Check out this fancy artsy Pace Calculator for calculating splits! I made it before I really understood how to make functions so check out the mess of source code on that. Yikes!</p>
				</a>
				<a href="/art/ColorsOfPi">
					<h1>Colors Of Pi</h1>
					<p>This one is more of an art project that depicts the hexidecimal colors that pi makes when you split it into sixes. For your viewing pleasure!</p>
				</a>

				<p>
					In the near future I will add a link to my resume, which if you're here, you are probably holding. Sites that I find interesting and you might too. A video of a speech I gave that some people thought was good. My facebook, twitter, and instagram accounts because I am a child and MUST have all of those. And a LinkedIn once I grow up and make one so you can connect with me if you deem me worthwhile. Thanks!
				</p>
