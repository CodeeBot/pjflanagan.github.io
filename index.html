				<div class="header">ABOUT ME</div>
				<h1 style="text-align:center;margin-left:0;margin-top:-10px;font-size:18px;"><a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterjflan">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peterjflan">Facebook</a> | <a href="http://instagram.com/pjflanagan1/">Instagram</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/public-profile-settings?trk=prof-edit-edit-public_profile">LinkedIn</a></h1>
				<p>I just obtained this domain (special thanks to MHacks).  While this website is a work in progress, I wanted to share it so you can learn a little about me. </p>
				<p>I'm Peter Flanagan, and I am a computer science major at the University of Michigan. I was born in rainy Seattle Washington, and moved around until the third grade when I found my home in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I began programming in middle school when my computer applications teacher told me I made a great looking website. That year I submitted a website on Fractal Geometry to the <a href="https://seelio.com/w/10v9/pennsylvania-state-computer-fair?student=flanapet">PA State Computer Fair</a>. I won second place at the state finals and was now hooked on computer science.</p>
				<p>Since then I have learned a lot and I have improved my web designing skills.  I have continued to do some graphic design and have significantly expanded my programming knowledge into other areas.  The following is a sample of what I have been up to. </p>

				<a href="/MRun/"><h1>MRun</h1></a>
				<p>Click here to view the Michigan Running Club website project I am currently creating. Assuming I am elected MRun Webmaster, I will be responsible for updating and managing the Running Club website as well as other online communications. I am especially excited about this role as I have been a dedicated runner since middle school and continue to compete in college. </p>
				
				<a href="/PaceCalculator"><h1>Pace Calculator</h1></a>
				<p>I also love fonts and minimalism. If you feel the same then check out this Pace Calculator used for calculating splits in running competitions. It features two of my favorite fonts and uses only two colors. It works great on mobile too.  I had many running friends use it in high school and now have a new fan club at Michigan. </p>
				
				<a href="/art/ColorsOfPi"><h1>Colors Of Pi</h1></a>
				<p>This is a more “artsy” project that depicts the hexadecimal colors that pi makes when you split pi into sixes. For example: 3.14159 becomes #314159, which is a shade of blue, and 265358 becomes #262358 which is a shade of greyish-green.  Check out the site.  It is actually pretty cool, especially if you like math. If you are a true nerd, then make it your desktop screen saver!</p>

				<br/>
				<p>I'm working on adding more of my art projects and previous working website designs onto here in addition to spicing up this page itself.  Check back in March to see my updates.  In the meantime, if you are looking for a summer intern with a passion for computer science and web design, please shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:pjflanagan1@gmail.com" target="_blank">pjflanagan1@gmail.com</a>. You can also access my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N3cUQdC13cQLbZvUauE21T9Ftnz1HUuOHCwmrTjnuwQ&authuser=0" target="_blank">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> by clicking the link. </p>
