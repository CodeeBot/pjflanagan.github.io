				<p>I just obtained this domain (special thanks to MHacks) so this website is currently on its way to being done. In the meantime feel free to see what I'm up to below!</p>
				<p>Hi there! I'm Peter Flanagan, and I am computer science major at the University of Michigan. I was born in rainy Seattle Washington, and moved around until the third grade when I found my home in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I began programming in middle school when my computer applications teacher told me I made a decent looking website. That year I submitted a small website on Fractal Geometry to the <a href="https://seelio.com/w/10v9/pennsylvania-state-computer-fair?student=flanapet">PA State Computer Fair</a>. I won second place at the state finals, and was instantly trust into a world of wanting to know more.</p>
				<p>Since then I've improved my web designing skills, done graphic design for my student organization, and have expanded my programming knowledge into other areas.</p>

				<a href="/MRun/"><h1>MRun</h1></a>
				<p>Click here to view the Michigan Running Club website project I am working on! If I am elected MRun Webmaster, I'll be responsible for creating, updating, and managing the current Running Club website among other online communications. Outside of hoping to be webmaster, I am also a dedicated runner 800 meter and Mile runner as I was since middle school.</p>
				
				<a href="/PaceCalculator"><h1>Pace Calculator</h1></a>
				<p>Along with the running theme, I also love fonts and minimalism! If you do too check out this fancy artsy Pace Calculator for calculating splits! It features two of my favorite fonts and uses only two colors. It works great on mobile too!</p>
				
				<a href="/art/ColorsOfPi"><h1>Colors Of Pi</h1></a>
				<p>This one is another art project that depicts the hexadecimal  colors that pi makes when you split it into sixes. For example: 3.14159 becomes #314159, which is a shade of blue. If you are nerdy and like Pi, I would suggest checking it out. It also looks great as a desktop background if I do say so myself.</p>

				<br/>
				<p>I'm working on adding more of my art projects and previous working website designs onto here in addition to spicing up this page itself! If you like what you see here then please shoot me an email, I'm happy to work/intern for you! <a href="mailto:pjflanagan1@gmail.com" target="_blank">pjflanagan1@gmail.com</a></p>
