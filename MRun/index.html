			<p class="p1">...MRun is the running club at the University of Michigan. One of the founding clubs in the club running scene, MRun has since been a dominate force. Since its inception in 2004, the club has grown to a membership of over 200 dues-paying undergraduate and graduate students. This makes MRun not only the biggest, most popular, and fastest growing club on campus, but also the largest collegiate running club in the nation. Racing in varsity and club Cross Country and Track and Field meets across the Midwest, MRun is very competitive within collegiate running. The MRun men were national champions at the 2010 NIRCA Cross Country Championships meet, while the women completed the same feat in 2008. The MRun men and women have had top-five finishes within the NCTFA National Track and Field meet. Members of the club win races at the 5k, 10k, and marathon distances. MRun also caters to track and field athletes and has year-round training for sprinters and field competitors. Because MRun competes in indoor and outdoor track, distance, sprint, and field event track athletes are able to travel around the country and compete in a long winter and spring season against club and varsity athletes.</p>
			<p id="p2">Although MRun is very competitive, it accomodates all types of runners, and thus all ability levels are welcome. There are no cuts, try-outs, or time trials to join the club. Whether you wish to compete against colleges nationwide, run in actual varsity races, or just show up a few times a week and run with friends, MRun is the right club for you. MRun provides more than just an outlet for running; it is also a large charitable organization, deeply involved within the community. This year alone the club as a whole raised over $11,000 for various local and national charities, including: Special Olympics, The American Cancer Society, and myTeam Triumph. MRun also provides a very social atmosphere which is inviting to newcomers.</p>

				<div class="headline" id="xc">CROSS-COUNTRY</div>
				<div class="subline">8k, 10k, 2k15</div>
				<p class="p1">In the fall, MRun competes in National Intercollegiate Running Club Association (NIRCA) cross country races. There are no tryouts, cuts, or qualifying times for the team, so anyone who wants to race is welcome! Most races are 8k for men and 6k for women, with a few 5k races sprinkled in.</p>
				<p>MRun travels to several local NIRCA meets in the fall, as well as a select few collegiate varsity races. See the schedules tab for more information on races.</p>
				<p>MRun enjoys a reputation as one of the most competitive clubs in the nation. The men and women have finished very well in the National Championships every year since the inception of NIRCA. The women were National Champions in 2008, while the men's team brought home the gold in 2010.</p>

				<!--<h1>Relay for Life</h1>
				<p>The Running Club participates in the U of M Relay for Life, a fundraiser for the American Cancer Society held at Palmer Field in April of each year. The idea is for every team to have someone walking around the track at all times, but naturally, as a running club, we run around the track for all 24 hours! In 2011, we walked/ran 530 miles in 24 hours. For our spirit and dedication to the event, we have received the Most Spirited Team Award at Relay for Life in 2008, 2009, and 2010. But most importantly, we have raised over $10,000 for cancer research through the years.</p>
				<h1>myTEAM TRIUMPH</h1>
				<p>The running club partners with myTEAM TRIUMPH to help handicapped community members race in local road races. MyTEAM TRIUMPH is an athletic ride-along program created for children, teens, adults, and veterans with disabilities who would normally not be able to experience endurance events such as triathlons or road races. We have completed 5k and 10k races with our handicapped "team captains," and we hope to expand to half-marathons and other opportunities in the near future. More information about myTEAM TRIUMPH can be found at their website: http://www.myteamtriumph.com/</p>

				<h1>Nationals Shoe Drive</h1>
				<p>MRun hosts an annual shoe drive at the NIRCA Cross Country National Championships meet. We arrange for running clubs from across the country to bring old shoes with them to the meet and have them donated to local homeless shelters. We have a friendly competition between the clubs to see who can donate the most shoes. Since the program's inception in 2008, we have put hundreds of pairs of shoes on needy feet.</p>-->

The runners start at 6:00 in the morning on the Detroit river, and they take turns running the 182 miles across the state of Michigan. The runners will run a total of nearly 24 hours to finish in South Haven, on the coast of Lake Michigan. Leading up to the event, the participants engage with Special Olympics athletes and raise donations for Special Olympics Michigan to support this incredible organization.</p>
